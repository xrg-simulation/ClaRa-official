TILMedia Suite provides methods of calculation, which express thermo-physical properties of incompressible liquids, ideal gases as well as real fluids containing a vapor liquid equilibrium.
In each fluid category (Gas, Liquid and VLEFluids) mixtures may be created.
The mathematical equations of substance properties are optimized for stable and fast dynamic simulations of systems.
You may select substance data from different sources for your calculation:
<br>
<ul>
  <li> TLK developments: 113 substances</li>
  <li> External library REFPROP 10: 280 substances</li>
  <li> VDI Heat Atlas: 275 substances</li>
  <li> VDI-Guideline 4670: 10 substances</li>
  <li> External library CoolProp: 122 substances</li>
  <li> International Institute of Refrigeration (IIR), Secondary Working Fluids (SWF): 21 liquids</li>
  <li> NASA Glenn Coefficients: 2024 substances</li>
</ul>
<br>
All available substances are listed in the User's Guide: <a href=\"Modelica:TILMedia.UsersGuide.SubstanceNames\">Substance Names</a>.
On demand it is also possible to get interpolated property data, which are faster than TILMedia and REFPROP data.
